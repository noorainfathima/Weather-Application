# Weather App

A simple, interactive weather application that fetches real-time weather data for any city using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app provides current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and an icon representing the weather.

## Overview

The Weather App allows users to search for current weather information by entering a city name. The app fetches data from a weather API and displays relevant weather details with a clean, user-friendly interface. This project is great for learning how to work with APIs, manipulate the DOM, and handle asynchronous JavaScript.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetches live data from a weather API.
- **City Search**: Enter any city name to get current weather information.
- **Weather Icons**: Displays weather conditions with relevant icons (e.g., sun, cloud, rain).
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Sets up the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styles the app for a modern and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Fetches data from the API and dynamically updates the UI.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of a city in the search bar.
2. Click the search button to fetch and display weather information for that city.
3. View current temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather.

### Customization

- **Styling**: Update colors, fonts, and layout in `styles.css` to personalize the look of the app.
- **Additional Data**: Modify `script.js` to include more weather details, like wind speed or sunrise/sunset times.
